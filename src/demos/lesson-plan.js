 *
 * * React is a Javascript library that makes web development easier
 *
 * * Lots of companies use React. It's the most popular frontend
 * * framework. Learn React = Get a Job
 *
 * * What is required before starting to know React?
 * * Basic web development knowledge is helpful (CSS, HTML)
 * * Basic Javascript
 * * ES6 Javascript Syntax (We'll be going over this today)

/**

 *
 * * package.json - Contains info about project and lists dependencies or packages in your project (similar to requirement.txt for Python)
 *
 * * /public - Contains static files, put images here
 *
 * * index.html ---
 *
 * * React is a single page app, the entire app will be in one HTML file.
 *
 * * When a React app loads, the entire app is inserted in the div, with the ID of "root" in the index.html file.
 *
 * * We are not creating different files for different pages, it will exist within one index.html file
 *
 * * Why? The benefit if that when the page loads, the user will only need to download files once. Once the initial load is done, website is pretty fast!

 *
 * * var - is able to change, declared in global scope
 *
 * * It's standard to use const or let, and to avoid var since it's in the global scope, you can accidently change something you don't mean to
 *
 * ! Demo 1: Let's display our name in the React app
 *
 * * Using {}, allows us to put Javascript in our HTML code
 *
 * * Having a variable, allows us to use the same value multiple names

 * ! Demo 2: We can also set HTML to variables üò±
 *
 * ! Demo 3: Let's try and create a list of users.. notice how it's getting pretty ugly

/**
 * ? ‚≠êÔ∏è Creating components
 *
 * * Notice how the user variables are returning () around the HTML, this means that it's returning JSX
 *
 * * There's a better way to share logic, we can create components
 *
 * ! Demo 1: What's the difference between a function and component?
 *
 * * Components are always TitleCase
 *
 * * Components will always return UI
 *
 * * Why components? Components are used all the time in React.
 *
 * * Anytime you have a piece of code you want to reuse or organize in a certain way, you will always do this using components
 *
 * ! Demo 2: Create User component
 *
 * * Using components in other components requires a syntax similar to HTML tags
 *
 * * Our code looks a lot better!
 *
 * ! Demo 3: How can we make a component display dynamic data?
 *
 * * In normal functions you can pass arguments, in React you can do the same with components, called props
 *
 * * Props is a Javascript object that all React components accept as a parameter
 *
 * * We can pass any kind of data we want
 *
 * * Really easy to write code to make it dynamic, with minimal changes to how it's implemented! üò±üò±

/**
 * ? ‚≠êÔ∏è State in React
 *
 * * A state is variable that holds data
 *
 * * State is a special variable that when it's assign a new value, it re renders or updates the page
 *
 * ! Demo 1: How you would think changing a variable would work
 *
 * * React as onClick, or event listeners as properties of the HTML element
 *
 * * React will generate UI once, when th page loads, it doesn't know when to rerender or update
 *
 * * States tell React to rerender or update
 *
 * ! Demo 2: useState hook
 *
 * * A hook is just a function that deals with state, always starts with "use"
 *
 * ! Demo 3: Array destructuring
 *
 * ! Demo 4: useState's value and setter
 *
 * * First variable is the name of the variable you want to change
 *
 * * Second variable is the setter of what yuo want to change
 *
 * * It is convention to name it set<Name of First variable>
 *
 * * Inside of useState take's the initial value
 *
 * * This works because, React looks to see if the state's value is different from before, if it is then it will update the UI
